001.cpp (12ms):

Scan from back to end. As long as we find an element nums[i] > nums[i-1], we know that nums[i-1] should be updated to the smallest element larger than it among {nums[i], nums[i+1], ..., nums[n-1]}. Then we should sort the elements {nums[i], nums[i+1], ..., nums[n-1]}. Notice that if we cannot find such an element nums[i] > nums[i-1], then we should sort the whole array.
