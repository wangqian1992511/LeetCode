001.cpp (8ms):

It is natural to think of using binary search in this problem. It is easier for us to judge whether a particular element is in a monotomic list or not with the time complexity of O(1), thus we should discuss under two different circumstances (the monotomic list is on the left or right hand side of the middle element). Pay attention to the equality sign. The whole time complexity is O(log(n)).
