# Problem

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

# Solution

A hash map is used as a counter for each character. Add one for each char in s, and minus one for each char in t. As long as we get a -1 in a counter, we get the answer.
