Solve it step by step carefully.

1. Determine whether the final answer is negative or not, and make numerator and denominator positive.
2. Determine the integral part directly.
3. Caculate the number of factor 2 and 5 in b, so we know the number of non-repeating decimals in the answer.
4. The remaining part must be repeating. Keep dividing "a" by "b" and updating "a", until we find a processed "a".
