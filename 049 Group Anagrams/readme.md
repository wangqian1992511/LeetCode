# Problem

Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

For example, given: ``["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]``, 
Return:

```
[
  ["ate", "eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
```

# Solution

Use a hash map to group all the anagrams. The key is generated by sorting the characters in one word.
