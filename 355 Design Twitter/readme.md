# Problem

Design a simplified version of Twitter where users can post tweets, follow/unfollow another user and is able to see the 10 most recent tweets in the user's news feed. Your design should support the following methods:

postTweet(userId, tweetId): Compose a new tweet.
getNewsFeed(userId): Retrieve the 10 most recent tweet ids in the user's news feed. Each item in the news feed must be posted by users who the user followed or by the user herself. Tweets must be ordered from most recent to least recent.
follow(followerId, followeeId): Follower follows a followee.
unfollow(followerId, followeeId): Follower unfollows a followee.
Example:

```
Twitter twitter = new Twitter();

// User 1 posts a new tweet (id = 5).
twitter.postTweet(1, 5);

// User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5].
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);

// User 1 follows user 2.
twitter.follow(1, 2);

// User 2 posts a new tweet (id = 6).
twitter.postTweet(2, 6);

// User 1's news feed should return a list with 2 tweet ids -> [6, 5].
// Tweet id 6 should precede tweet id 5 because it is posted after tweet id 5.
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);

// User 1 unfollows user 2.
twitter.unfollow(1, 2);

// User 1's news feed should return a list with 1 tweet id -> [5],
// since user 1 is no longer following user 2.
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);
```

# Solution

We should maintain the 10 most recent tweet post by one user with dequeue. We should also use hash table to record the post time of each tweet and the followee of each user.

Obtaining the 10 most recent tweet from one user's followee and himself is similar to [Problem 23](../023%20Merge%20k%20Sorted%20Lists). One followee corresponds to one sorted list. We should use a heap to achieve this.
